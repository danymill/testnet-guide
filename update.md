# Updating the App

Your App is configured to auto-update with newly released versions which include bug fixes and various improvements. We expect to routinely update the App and the Smesher during the lifetime of the Open Testnet.

You can also check for updates manually at any time from the App settings screen.

Spacemesh may also occasionally ask you to perform the mining step again after an app update.

Please join the [Testnet Community Channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/Mf8T4Db) - we will post important update related announcement there and on the [Spacemesh Twitter account](https://twitter.com/teamspacemesh)
