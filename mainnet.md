# Getting Ready for Mainnet

By running a Testnet full node and using the wallet to transact with Spacemesh Coin you are readying yourself for the Spacemesh Mainnet.

The Spacemesh Mainnet is going to launch after several months after the Testnet. The main goal of the Testnet is to perform tests that will enable us to launch a high-quality and secure Mainent.

Running a full node on the Mainnet and using the Wallet is going to be very similar to doing these things on the Testnet. So, by joining the Testnet today you make sure you'll be able to join the Spacemesh Mainent when it launches quickly and seamlessly.

The sooner you and other people like you join the Mainnet on launch date, the more secure and distributed Spacemesh becomes.

You should think about the amount of free space you are planning to allocate for the Spacemesh Mainent and setup the proper drive before Mainnet launch. We also recommend trying to use the same amount of storage in the Testnet.
