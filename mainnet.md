# Getting Ready for Mainnet

By running a Testnet Smesher and using the wallet to transact with Smesh you are readying yourself for the Spacemesh Mainnet.

The Spacemesh Mainnet is going to launch several months after the Testnet. The main goal of the Testnet is to perform various tests that will enable us to launch a high-quality and secure Mainnet.

Running a Smesher on the Mainnet and using the Wallet is going to be very similar to doing these things on the Testnet. So, by joining the Testnet today you make sure you'll be able to join the Spacemesh Mainnet when it launches quickly and seamlessly.

The sooner you and other people like you join the Mainnet on launch date, the more secure and distributed Spacemesh becomes and the more you help us to get to Mainent.

You should think about the amount of free space you are planning to commit for the Spacemesh Mainnet and setup the proper drive with sufficient free disk space before Mainnet launch.

When the Mainnet launches you'll be able to use the Spacemesh App for the Mainnet in the same way you have used it on the Testnet.
