# Getting Ready for Mainnet

By [running a Testnet Smesher](guide/setup.md) and [using the Wallet](wallet.md) to transact with SMH you are readying yourself for the launch of the Spacemesh Mainnet.

The Spacemesh Mainnet will launch several months after the Testnet. The main goal of the Testnet is to perform various tests that will enable us to launch a high-quality and secure Mainnet.

Running a Smesher on the Mainnet and using the Wallet is going to be very similar to doing these things on the Testnet. So, by joining the Testnet today you make sure you'll be able to join the Spacemesh Mainnet quickly and seamlessly when it launches. The sooner you and others join the Mainnet on launch date, the more secure and distributed Spacemesh becomes and the more you help us to get to Mainnet.

Consider the amount of free space you'd like to commit to the Spacemesh Mainnet, and set up the proper drive with sufficient free disk space before Mainnet launch.

When the Mainnet launches you'll be able to use the Spacemesh App for the Mainnet in the same way you have used it on the Testnet.
