# Using the Spacemesh Wallet

The Spacemesh App includes a wallet for managing your Spacemesh Coins.
Follow the instructions on this mini wallet guide to work with your wallet.

## Accessing your wallet
Your wallet is created when you open the Spacemesh App for the first time. You were prompted to secure your wallet with a passphrase which we recommended you store in your `password manager app` such as [1Password](#).

Your wallet data is saved in a wallet file on your hard drive. The wallet file includes sensitive private data which is encrypted in the file.

When you open the Spacemesh App and click on the wallet command in the main screen for the first time, the App will prompt you for your wallet passphrase in order to load the wallet data from the wallet file.

Just enter your passphrase to access your wallet.

!> Remember that until you create a wallet paper backup, you will lose access to your wallet, if you forget your wallet passphrase.
This is why we recommend you to create a paper backup as soon as possible.

## Checking your Spacemesh Coin Balance

Click on the wallet command in the menu on the left side of the screen.

You should see a screen similar to this:

Your wallet is configured with one main address called `Public Address`. Think of this address as your crypto bank account number. You use this address to hold Spacemesh Coins and transact with others.

Your wallet's `public address` balance is displayed below the address:

Each address has a friendly name (In this case it is `public address`) and a unique set of numbers similar to a unique bank account checking account number.

Your balance is displayed below the public address. SMC is the symbol for Spacemesh Coins. In the image above, the public address as 6.9998 Spacemesh Coins. The estimated USD value of your balance is displayed above the SMC balance amount.

?> You can copy the address to your computer's clipboard by clicking on the copy icon next to the address. You can also create additional addresses in your wallet at any time.

## Sending Coins
To send a coin to another person, you need to know their Spacemesh address.

## Receiving Coins

## Locking Access

?> When you are done using the wallet in the App you should `log out` from it to prevent other people with access to your computer from viewing your coin balance, perform transactions or view your transactions history.  

To log-out from you wallet, just click on `log out` or close the App main window by clicking on the close button of the main App Window.

To log-in again to your wallet, open the app and click on the Wallet command in the left side of the screen. You will need to enter your wallet passphrase again to access your wallet.

## Backing up
The are two main ways to backup your wallet, wallet file backup and a phrases backup.

### 1. Wallet File Backup
!> A file backup allows you to restore you wallet using the wallet file and your passphrase. You can't restore your wallet without having the file and remember your passphrase.

1. Click 'Backup Wallet File' in the App

A window will open showing where the wallet file is stored on your hard-drive and the wallet file will be selected.

2. Copy the selected wallet file to a USB drive or to another hard drive.

We recommend saving the backup file to a USB drive and storing the drive in a safe place.

?> The sensitive data is stored encrypted in your wallet file as a security measure. So your Spacemesh Coin held in the wallet are safe even if someone gains access to the file. That said, please take care and make sure that access to your wallet backup is not provided to others. For example, do not save a backup on the cloud in a location that is accessible to anyone.

### 2. Phrases Backup

The phrases backup option allows you to save a list of 12 English words in a safe place. These phrases can be used to restore your wallet even in the case that you forget your wallet passphrase.

In this kind of backup, you print or write down a list of 12 English phrases.

!> Note that the order of the phrases in the list is important and you will need to provide these words in the same order to restore your wallet.

Follow these steps if you have a safe or a secure location for sensitive documents:
1. Click `Phrases Backup` in the App
2. Write down or print the 12 words list displayed in the App.
3. Store the paper with the words in a safe place such as a safe. Do not leave it next to your computer.
4. Click on `Done` to hide the words

!> Do NOT use your mobile phone camera to take a photo of your computer screen in order to save the words. As anyone with access to your photos will be able to steal your wallet coin balance.

If you don't have a safe or a secure location for private documents then follow these steps to store the phrases in your password manager app:

1. Click `Phrases Backup` in the App
2. Click `Copy` to copy the words list to your clipboard
3. Open your password manager app and create a new item. e.g. My Main Wallet.
4. Paste the copied words list into your item details or note.
5. Click on `Done` to hide the words and to clear your clipboard.
