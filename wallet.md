# Using the Spacemesh Wallet

The Spacemesh App includes a wallet for managing your Spacemesh Coins.
Follow the instructions on this mini wallet guide to work with your wallet.

## Accessing your wallet
Your wallet is created when you open the Spacemesh App for the first time. You were prompted to secure your wallet with a passphrase which we recommended you store in your `password manager app` such as [1Password](#).

Your wallet data is saved in a wallet file on your hard drive. The wallet file includes sensitive private data which is encrypted in the file.

When you open the Spacemesh App and click on the wallet command in the main screen for the first time, the App will prompt you for your wallet passphrase in order to load the wallet data from the wallet file.

Just enter your passphrase to access your wallet.

!> Remember that until you create a wallet paper backup, you will lose access to your wallet, if you forget your wallet passphrase.
This is why we recommend you to create a paper backup as soon as possible.

## Checking your Spacemesh Coin Balance

Click on the wallet command in the menu on the left side of the screen.

You should see a screen similar to this:

Your wallet is configured with one main address called `Public Address`. Think of this address as your crypto bank account number. You use this address to hold Spacemesh Coins and transact with others.

Your wallet's `public address` balance is displayed below the address:

Each address has a friendly name (In this case it is `public address`) and a unique set of numbers similar to a unique bank account checking account number.

Your balance is displayed below the public address. SMC is the symbol for Spacemesh Coins. In the image above, the public address as 6.9998 Spacemesh Coins. The estimated USD value of your balance is displayed above the SMC balance amount.

?> You can copy the address to your computer's clipboard by clicking on the copy icon next to the address. You can also create additional addresses in your wallet at any time.

## Locking Access

?> When you are done using the wallet in the App you should `log out` from it to prevent other people with access to your computer from viewing your coin balance, perform transactions or view your transactions history.  

To log-out from you wallet, just click on `log out` or close the App main window by clicking on the close button of the main App Window.

To log-in again to your wallet, open the app and click on the Wallet command in the left side of the screen. You will need to enter your wallet passphrase again to access your wallet.
