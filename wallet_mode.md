# Wallet-only Mode

You can use the Spacemesh App wallet features without running a full Spacemesh p2p node on your laptop or desktop computer. In this mode there is no mining and you can only perform Spacemesh Coin transactions using the wallet, check your balance and view  transactions other people have executed which transfer coins to your account.

> When running in wallet-only-mode you do NOT need to leave your computer on 24x7 or configure your network to accept incoming connections.

> You can at any time setup mining and start a Spacemesh full p2p node at a later time by clicking on the `MINING` command at the top left of the App main screen.
