# Friends & Family Net (ffnet)

## Welcome!
Welcome dear friends & family to the Spacemesh f&f net!
This is an early tech preview of the Spacemesh App and full node and expect things to be rough around the edges and some things that should be automated are manual and sub-optimal.

## Joining

1 .First please join the [ffnet discord channel](#). We are going to provide additional info, answer your questions and get your feedback on it!

2. To join the net you need to run the Spacemesh App on an always-on desktop computer. Please check if your system meets the [recommended system requirements](requirements.md).

    *Please do NOT attempt to join from a laptop you often move between different WIFI networks. Things will not work properly*.

3. Download the App installer from this link:

    [Spacemesh App Installer (ffnet release)](#)

4. *Before running*, you MUST configure your network to accept incoming TCP and UDP packets on a specific port number. Please [follow this guide](http://localhost:3000/#/netconfig) but you can use any port and not just 7153.

    *You will not be able to join the network unless you have completed this step*

5. Install and run the App. You will be prompted for a port number. Enter the port number you have configured to accept incoming packets from the Internet and proceed to setup smeshing.

## Getting some Smesh
You can request Smesh from the App by pasting your account address from your wallet in the f&f discord channel. This should allow you to create coin transactions before you get any smeshing rewards. You should start getting rewards in 48 hours.
