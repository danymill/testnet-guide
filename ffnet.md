# Friends & Family Net (ffnet)

## Welcome!
Welcome dear Spacemesh friend to the Spacemesh f&f net!
This is an early tech preview of the Spacemesh App and full node and expect things to be rough around the edges and some things that should be automated are manual and sub-optimal.

## What to expect?
Chaos, broken things but also a glimpse on an awesome near future where anyone in the world can mine a fair cryptocurrency from home using his existing computer while still being able to play Fortnite on it without understanding what CLI and Terminal mean :-)

## Why are we doing this?
We want to give you a sneak peek of the Spacemesh technology and product, test them with your help and improve them by getting good feedback from you!

## Joining

1. Join the [ffnet discord channel](https://discord.gg/KyyQKst). We are going to provide additional info, answer your questions, announce app updates and get your feedback on it!

2. To join the net you need to run the Spacemesh App on an always-on desktop computer. Please ensure that your system meets the [recommended system requirements](requirements).

    *Please do NOT attempt to join from a laptop you often move between different WIFI networks. Things will not work properly*.

    *Please do NOT join if your computer or network connection doesn't meet the recommended requirements*.


3. Configure your network to accept incoming TCP and UDP packets on a specific port number. Please [follow this guide](netconfig) but you can use any port and not just 7153.

    *You will NOT be able to join the network unless you have completed this step.*

4. Download the App installer and run it:

    [Spacemesh App Installer (ffnet release)](#)

5. Run the Spacemesh App. You will be prompted for a port number. Enter the port number you have configured to accept incoming packets from the Internet and proceed to setup smeshing.

6. Proceed to setup smeshing and your wallet. [Follow this guide](/guide/setup) for step by step instructions.

## Getting some Smesh
You can request Smesh from the App by pasting your account address from your wallet in the [ffnet discord channel](https://discord.gg/KyyQKst). This should allow you to create coin transactions before you get any smeshing rewards. You should start getting rewards in 48 hours.

## How long will this net run?
Until we soft launch the open Spacemesh testnet.

## How do I give feedback or get help?
