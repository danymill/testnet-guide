# Friends & Family Net (ffnet)

## Welcome!
Welcome dear Spacemesh friend to the Spacemesh ffnet! This is an early tech preview of the Spacemesh App and full node. Expect things to be rough around the edges and expect some things that should be automated to be manual and sub-optimal, for now.

## What to expect?

Chaos, broken things but also a glimpse of an awesome near future where anyone in the world can mine a fair cryptocurrency from home using their existing computer while still being able to play Fortnite without understanding what CLI and Terminal mean ðŸ¤“

## Why are we doing this?

We want to give you a sneak peek of the Spacemesh technology and product, test them with your help and improve them with your feedback!

## Joining

1. Join the [ffnet discord channel](https://discord.gg/KyyQKst). On this channel we will provide additional info, answer your questions, announce app updates and get your feedback!

2. To join the ffnet you need to run the Spacemesh App on an always-on desktop computer. Please ensure that your system meets the [recommended system requirements](requirements).

    *Please do NOT attempt to join from a laptop if you often move between different WIFI networks. Things will not work properly.*

    *Please do NOT join if your computer or network connection doesn't meet the recommended requirements.*

3. Download the App installer and run it to install the App:

        [Spacemesh App Installer (ffnet release)](#)


4. Before running the Spacemesh App, configure your network to accept incoming TCP and UDP packets on a specific port number. Please [follow this guide](netconfig.md) but you can use any port and not just 7153.

    *You will NOT be able to join the network unless you have completed this step.*

5. Run the Spacemesh App. You will be prompted for a port number. Enter the port number you have configured to accept incoming packets from the Internet and proceed to setup smeshing.

6. Proceed to setup smeshing and your wallet. [Follow this guide](/guide/setup) for step by step instructions.

## Getting some Smesh
You should start getting your first smeshing reward in 24-48 hours from the time you finish the smeshing setup.

You can also request some Smesh from the ffnet tap by copying and pasting your account address from your wallet screen into the [ffnet discord channel](https://discord.gg/KyyQKst). This should allow you to execute Smesh transactions before getting your first reward.

## How long will this net run?
Until we soft launch the open Spacemesh testnet.

## How do I give feedback or get help?
