## Testnet Disclaimer

During the initial development cycle for Spacemesh, a research and development phase is being deployed and this includes the soft release of the Spacemesh Testnet (the "Testnet"). The Testnet is designed to test the Spacemesh protocols and software prior to release of the Spacemesh Mainnet and the Spacemesh cryptocurrency. The Testnet is designed to run security and code audits of the Spacemesh software and protocols.

By using the Testnet, you agree to these terms and acknowledge and agree that Spacemesh is at a very early stage of development and that use of the Testnet is entirely at your sole risk.

With respect to any rewards program offered as part of the Testnet framework, such program may change at any time and it may be necessary to perform a KYC/AML procedure. All approval requirements will be announced before the endline. The participants in this phase are aware that they may not receive the rewards if the KYC/AML procedures are not approved. You should consult your own attorney, financial advisor, tax advisor or accountant as to the legal, financial, tax, accounting, or other related implications of the receipt of any rewards hereunder.
