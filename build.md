# Build and Run from Source Code

You can build the Spacemesh Full Node and CLI wallet directly from source code, and run the node without installing the Spacemesh App.

> You can build on Linux or on OS X. Building on Windows 10 is not yet supported.

## Linux Notes

The Spacemesh App which includes the full p2p node and a wallet is supported on any Linux distro that supports [Electron Apps](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support).

If you are running a Linux that doesn't support Electron than you can build and run a full p2p node and a CLI wallet.
