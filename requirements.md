## Operational Notes

### CPU Usage
As long as your system and configuration meets the recommended requirements, the Spacemesh App ongoing usage of your CPU should be limited during normal operation (after the initial setup phase) to 2 CPU cores.

### Network Config
You must configure your network to allow the App to accept incoming connections on UDP port 7153 and on TCP port 7153. Follow [this guide](netconfig.md) to configure your network.

### Laptop Usage
You can install the App, run a Node and produce blocks on your laptop if it meets the minimum system requirements. However, you will need to make sure you leave your laptop open and connected to power and to the Internet 24/7.

Occasionally shutting down your laptop or the App may prevent you from producing blocks and from earning block production coin awards.
