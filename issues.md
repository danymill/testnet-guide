## Help improve Spacemesh

You can help us improve Spacemesh by sending us a report of any issue you come across while running the App.

### What is an issue?
Anything you think is unexpected behavior in the Spacemesh App. Anything that prevented you from completing an action that the App supports. For example, executing a transaction or setting up Smeshing.

### Reporting an issue
There are two ways to report bugs:
1. Email a description of your issue to [bugs@spacemesh.io](mailto:bugs@spacemesh.io).
2. Create a new topic for your issue in the [Testnet community forum](https://community.spacemesh.io/c/testnet/5).

When reporting a bug, please try to provide the following information:

1. `DESCRIPTION`: A clear description of what you were trying to do with the App that you believed caused the issue.
2. `STEPS`: What are the steps of interacting with the app that cause the issue?
3. `BEHAVIOR`: A clear description of the issue itself. What happened that you didn't expect to happen following the steps?
4. `EXPECTED`: What you expected to happen that didn't happen?

!> Please add to your report any `applicable screen shots` and please also try to include `a zip file of your app's log file`. The log file is called `spacemeshlog.txt` and it is located in your `documents folder`.

## An Example Issue Report
1. `DESCRIPTION`: Can't send Smesh to an address.
2. `STEPS`: Clicked 'SEND SMH', entered transaction details, pasted account I got in Whatsapp from my friend and clicked 'SEND'.
3. `BEHAVIOR`: Got an error message stating that something went wrong...
4. `EXPECTED`: Have my transaction sent and confirmed without errors.

Here's a screen shot of the error message I got. Also - attaching my log file.
