## Help improve Spacemesh

You can help us improve Spacemesh by sending us a report of any issue you come across while running the App.

There are two ways to report bugs:
1. Email a description of your issue to [bugs@spacemesh.io](mailto:bugs@spacemesh.io).
2. Create a new topic for your issue in the [Testnet community forum](https://community.spacemesh.io/c/testnet/5).

When reporting a bug, please provide a clear description of what you were trying to do with the App that caused an issue, what happened - the issue itself, and what you expected to happen and didn't happen.

Attach any applicable screen shot and ideally include a zip file of your app's log file. Your app's log file `log.txt` is stored in the following path on your hard-drive:
- Windows 10:
- Linux:
- OS X:
