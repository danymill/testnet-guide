## Help improve Spacemesh

You can help us improve Spacemesh by sending us a report of any issue you come across while running the App.

### What is an issue?
Anything you think is unexpected behavior in the Spacemesh App. Anything that prevented you from completing an action that the App supports. For example, executing a transaction or setting up Smeshing.

There are two ways to report bugs:
1. Email a description of your issue to [bugs@spacemesh.io](mailto:bugs@spacemesh.io).
2. Create a new topic for your issue in the [Testnet community forum](https://community.spacemesh.io/c/testnet/5).

When reporting a bug, please provide a clear description of what you were trying to do with the App that triggered an issue, what happened - the issue itself, and what you expected to happen that didn't happen.

For example - you got an error message while trying to execute a transaction. You expected to be able to execute the transaction and not get an error message.

Please add to your report any applicable screen shots and please also try to include a zip file of your app's log file. Your app's log file is called `spacemeshlog.txt` and it is saved in your computer documents folder.
