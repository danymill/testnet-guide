A window will open showing where the wallet file is stored on your hard-drive and the wallet file will be selected.

2. Copy the selected wallet file to a USB drive or to another hard drive.

We recommend saving the backup file to a USB drive and storing the drive in a safe place.

?> The sensitive data is stored encrypted in your wallet file as a security measure. So your Spacemesh Coin held in the wallet are safe even if someone gains access to the file. That said, please take care and make sure that access to your wallet backup is not provided to others. For example, do not save a backup on the cloud in a location that is accessible to anyone.

### 12 Words Backup

The phrases backup option allows you to save a list of 12 English words in a safe place. These phrases can be used to restore your wallet even in the case that you forget your wallet passphrase.

In this kind of backup, you print or write down a list of 12 English phrases.

!> Note that the order of the phrases in the list is important and you will need to provide these words in the same order to restore your wallet.

Follow these steps if you have a safe or a secure location for sensitive documents:
1. Click `Phrases Backup` in the backup options screen:
