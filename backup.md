## Backing up your Wallet
The are two ways to backup your wallet, `File Backup` and `12 Words Backup`.

We recommend you to use the more secure and robust `12 Words Backup`.

You will be prompted to backup your wallet until you backup it in the wallet main screen:

### Wallet File Backup

A file backup allows you to restore you wallet using a backup file and your password. You can only restore your wallet from a backup data file if you remember your password.

File backup is useful for restoring access to your wallet on another computer, or in case that your wallet data file is corrupted or accidentally deleted.

> We recommend you will also backup your wallet using the `12 Words Backup` method because it enables you to restore your wallet even if you lose your wallet data file or if you forgot your password.


1. Click the `BACKUP YOUR WALLET` in the wallet screen or click 'BACKUP' in the wallet settings section of the settings screen.

You should see this screen:

2. Click the 'FILE BACKUP' button.

> The App creates a backup file and stores it on your computer's hard-drive.

You should now see this screen:

3. Click `BROWSE FILE LOCATION` to locate the new backup file in your computer's hard-drive.

A file browser will open up displaying where the backup file is stored on your hard-drive and the wallet file will be selected.

> You backup file name should be similar to this wallet file name: `Wallet_Backup_2019-09-17T17/03/22.712Z.json`

4. Copy the selected backup file to a USB drive or to another hard drive.

> We recommend saving the backup file to a USB drive and storing the drive in a safe place.

> Sensitive wallet data is stored encrypted in your wallet file as a security measure. So your Spacemesh Coins held in the wallet are safe even if someone gains access to the file. That said, please take care and make sure that access to your wallet backup file is limited to you. For example, do not save a backup file on the cloud in a location that is publicly accessible.

### 12 Words Backup

The 12 words backup method allows you to print or write down on a paper an ordered list of 12 English words that you need to store in a safe place.

You can at any time restore your wallet on any computer using the list without having to remember you wallet password or to have access to your wallet data file.

!> The order of the words in the list is important and you will need to provide the words in the same order when restoring a wallet from the list.

Follow these steps to create a 12 words backup:


1. Click the `BACKUP YOUR WALLET` in the wallet screen or click 'BACKUP' in the wallet settings section of the settings screen.

You should see this screen:

1. Click the `12 WORDS BACKUP` button.

You should now see a screen with an ordered list of 12 words:

Follow one or more of these steps:

- Write down the 12 words with a pen on a paper. Write the number next to each word.

- Click 'PRINT' and print the list using your printer.

- Click `COPY` and copy and paste the list to a secure note in your password manager app.

> If you printed the list or wrote it down on a paper, store the paper in a safe place such as a safe. Do NOT leave it next to your computer.

> Do NOT use your mobile phone camera to take a photo of your computer screen in order to save the words. Anyone with access to your photos will be able to steal your wallet coins from you.

3. Click 'NEXT' only after you performed one of the actions above.

You will now verify that you have access to the printed words list. The confirmation screen displays 4 words from your list and 12 empty slots:

4. Drag the 4 words displayed in the screen to their proper place in the list.

For example, if the word `impose` is word number 8 in the words list, then drag the word `impose` to slot number 8 in the empty list on the screen.

After dragging the 4 words to their correct location in the list you should see this screen with the confirmation message at the bottom-right side of the screen:
