# Installing and Running

Follow this guide to download, install and run a full Spacemesh Testnet p2p node on your desktop computer.

!> Before installing, please confirm that your system meets the [minimum system requirements](requirements.md).


## Step 1 - Download the Installer

The Spacemesh App includes the Spacemesh p2p node, a basic wallet and a p2p node dashboard.

You install the App to setup your p2p full node and you use the wallet to setup an award account for your full node.

?> The installer you are downloading was packaged from code in the [Spacemesh open source software repos](https://github.com/spacemeshos) on github and all software released by Spacemesh is 100% open source. We provide this installer to make it convenient for non-developers users to join Spacemesh. If you prefer and technically able, you can build and run the installer [directly from source code](soruce.md) instead of using the provided installer.

Download the App installer for your OS.

## Step 3 - Create a Wallet

You need a wallet to manage your Spacemesh Coins and to provide the platform with an address to award Spacemesh coins to you for participation in the platform by running a full p2p node. You also use the wallet to transfer coin to other people. You create a wallet in the Spacemesh App.

### Protect your wallet with a passphrase

[ Screen Shot - Passphrase]

The Spacemesh App will prompt you to enter a passphrase to protect your new wallet - proceed and choose a password. You will need to use the passphrase to open your wallet in future app sessions. We recommend that you'll save your passphrase in your computer secure password manager.

!> Important: until you backup your wallet from the app, you won't be able to access it without your passphrase. There is no way to restore a wallet that wasn't backed-up in case you forget your passphrase.

Your new wallet is configured with 1 default address. You can create additional addresses later, but for now, you will use this address as the awards address for coin awards that are due to your p2p node.
