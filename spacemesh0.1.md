Spacemesh 0.1 is the first release of the Spacemesh Testnet. We plan to release updates with additional features and capabilities on an on-going basis until the Mainnent.

This guide walks you though and describes the features and the supported functionality of this release.

## What is not part of Spacemesh 0.1

Here are some scenarios that are not yet supported in the Spacemesh 0.1 Testnet release:

1. Join the Testnet from a Node and a CLI wallet built directly from source code.
2. Get Smesh coins from a tap.
3. Browse the Testnet using a block explorer and a dashboard.
4. Run the App in Wallet-only mode without a Node.
5. Run a node without producing blocks.

We plan to introduce these roll out software to support these use cases in subsequent Spacemesh Testnet releases throughout 2020.
