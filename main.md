# Welcome to the Spacemesh Open Testnet Guide

> **WARNING: Dragons ahead!** The Spacemesh open testnet has not been launched yet. This is a work in progress and an incomplete guide.

We are happy to see you here. Please read the intro on this page to learn the basics about Spacemesh and the Spacemesh Testnet and then proceed to the installation guide to get up and running.

**tl;dr? Skip the intro** and [get started](guide/install.md)!

## What is Spacemesh?
Spacemesh is a programmable cryptocurrency open-source platform powered by a novel proof-of-space-time (PoST) consensus protocol. Spacemesh does not use proof-of-stake or proof-of-work (PoW) protocols, thus it avoids some of their inherent issues, such as massive energy waste, mining pooling and centralization.

## What does Spacemesh try to achieve?
Spacemesh  is designed to achieve three main objectives:
1. Create and maintain the ledger for the `Spacemesh Coin` - a fair cryptocurrency that will become a global means of payment.
2. Ensure fair distribution of the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency.
3. Establish a global programmable infrastructure for tokenized apps, communities and economies.

## What problems does Spacemesh plan to solve and how?

### Mining cryptocurrency today can only be done by a select few.
We aim to create a world in which any interested party can mine Spacemesh cryptocurrency, which will naturally be followed by a fair distribution of coin (i.e., `The People's Coin`).

### Energy consumption due to PoW chains is skyrocketing.
Spacemesh has improved upon PoW by creating a consensus protocol that consumes significantly less energy (i.e., `A Better Bitcoin`).

### Lack of satisfactory smart contracts infrastructure for creation of fair communities and decentralized financial services.
We plan to add a modern smart contracts virtual machine, called Spacemesh virtual machine (SVM), a new modern smart contracts language (Smesh) and dev tools designed for developers to build applications on the Spacemesh platform.

## What makes Spacemesh unique?
A mesh topology combined with a novel consensus PoST protocol that allows anyone to join the decentralized Spacemesh blockchain computer without requiring permission, simply by committing some free hard-drive space.

## The Spacemesh Protocol

Spacemesh software is designed to run on real people's home PCs and not on dedicated cloud servers or on specialized non-commodity hardware. A consensus on a distributed canonical ledger is formed by a protocol running on home PCs anywhere across the globe. The system remains secure as long as more than 2/3 majority of disk space committed to Spacemesh is by honest participants.

> To deep-dive into the technical details of the Spacemesh protocol, read the [Spacemesh Protocol paper](https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-protocol-v1-0).

## What is the Spacemesh Testnet?
The Spacemesh Testnet is a public beta release of the Spacemesh p2p software platform. Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can join without any permission from anywhere and participate in the Spacemesh p2p network.

The Testnet is designed to test the Spacemesh protocols and software prior to release of the Spacemesh Mainnet and the Spacemesh cryptocurrency. Note that the cryptocurrency enabled by the Testnet is ``monopoly money'' without any real world value.

## What is Spacemesh 0.1 ?
Spacemesh 0.1 is the name of the first release of the Testnet. Everything described in this guide is about this release. We are releasing capabilities that we believe are ready for testing. We have much more in the pipeline and we plan to release updates to the Testnet throughout 2020. This guide will be updated as we release new Testnet features.

## Why should I join the Spacemesh Testnet?
Joining the Testnet helps Spacemesh launch a high-quality Mainnet and the `Spacemesh Coin` (SMC) cryptocurrency. Spacemesh is a decentralized ledger designed to be formed from a large number of home desktop PC owners who run the Spacemesh software on their PCs. To test such a network we need a large number of block producers to join the Testnet.

Joining also helps you to prepare for participating in the Spacemesh Mainnet once it is launched.

> Bottom line: if you care about Spacemesh and plan to participate in the Mainnet, you will benefit by joining the Testnet.

In the true spirit of crypto-economy, we have launched this Testnet so that anyone can verify (rather than blindly trust) the 3 main promises we make:
1. The core technology and product work.
2. Participants don't have to do anything after the initial setup to run a Spacemesh full node.
3. Participants can their your computer normally while running a Spacemesh full node.

## How can I join the Spacemesh Testnet?
Just follow the instructions in this guide. Let's [get started](guide/install.md)!

## What do I need to join the Testnet?
To run a full p2p node, mine and to get coin awards you need `an always-on desktop computer` running Windows 10, OS X or a supported Linux distribution with at least 150 GB of free disk space (required free space is tentative and subject to change) on one of your hard drives.
