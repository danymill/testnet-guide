# Welcome to the Spacemesh Testnet Guide

> **Dragons Ahead!** The testnet haven't launched yet. This is a work in progress incomplete guide.

We are happy to see you here. To learn the basics about Spacemesh and the Testnet, please read the intro on this page.

**tl;dr? skip this intro** and [get started](guide/install.md)!

**Don't like to read much?** Watch the [Testnet Video Guide](#)

## What is Spacemesh?
Spacemesh is a programmable cryptocurrency open source platform powered by a novel proof-of-space-time (PoST) consensus protocol. Spacemesh does not use  proof of stake or proof of work protocols, thus it avoids some of the issues involved in such protocol such as massive energy waste, mining pooling and centralization.

## What does Spacemesh achieve?
Spacemesh  is designed to achieve three main objectives:
1. Create Spacemesh Coin - a fair cryptocurrency that will become a global means of payment.
2. Ensure  fair distribution of that cryptocurrency.
3. Establish a global programmable infrastructure for tokenized apps, communities and economies.

## What problems does Spacemesh solve?
1. Mining cryptocurrency today can only be done by a select few. We aim to create a world where any interested party can mine Spacemesh cryptocurrency, and with that, a fair distribution of coin will follow.  (i.e “the people's coin”)
2. Energy consumption due to PoW chains is skyrocketing. Spacemesh created a solution that improves on PoW by creating a consensus protocol that consumes significantly less energy. (i.e a “better Bitcoin”)
3. Lack of satisfactory blockchain and smart contracts infrastructure for creation of fair communities.

## What makes Spacemesh unique?
A mesh topology combined with a novel consensus PoST protocol that allows anyone to join the decentralized Spacemesh blockchain computer without requiring permission, simply by committing some of the free space on their hard-drives.

Spacemesh software is designed to run on real people's home PCs and not on dedicated cloud servers or specialized non-commodity hardware. A consensus on a distributed canonical ledger is formed by a protocol running on a home PCs from around the globe and without a central server as long as there's a majority of honest people running the Spacemesh software on their PCs.

## What is the Spacemesh Testnet?
The Spacemesh Testnet is a beta public release of the Spacemesh p2p software platform. Anyone with a computer and Internet connection can join without any permission from anyone and participate in the Spacemesh p2p network.

The Testnet is designed to test the Spacemesh protocols and software prior to release of the Spacemesh Mainnet and the Spacemesh cryptocurrency. Note that the cryptocurrency enabled by the Testnet is monopoly money without any real world value. The Testnet is designed to run security and code audits of the Spacemesh software and protocols.

## Why should I join?
Joining the Testnet helps Spacemesh launch a high-quality Mainnet and the Spacemesh Coins cryptocurrency. It also helps you to prepare your for participation in the Spacemesh Mainnet once it launches and earn Spacemesh coins validation awards for your participation. Bottom line, if you care about Spacemesh and plan to participate in its Mainnet then you should join the Testnet.

In the true spirit of crypto, we launch this testnet so anyone can verify (and not trust) 3 main promises we make:
1. The core technology and product works
2. You don't have do anything after the initial setup to run a full node
3. You can use your computer normally while running a Spacemesh full node

## How can I join?
Just follow our interactive guide to join the Testnet. Let's [get started](guide/install.md)!
