# Welcome to the Spacemesh Testnet Guide

!> **Dragons Ahead!** The testnet haven't launched yet. This is a work in progress incomplete guide.

We are happy to see you here. To learn the basics about Spacemesh and the Testnet, please read the intro on this page.

**tl;dr? skip this intro** and [get started](guide/install.md)!

**Don't like to read much?** Watch the [Testnet Video Guide](#)

## What is Spacemesh?
Spacemesh is a p2p blockchain open source software for creating a permissionless and scalable cryptocurrency called Spacemesh Coin using a novel proof of space-time based consensus protocol. Spacemesh achieves this without using proof of stake or proof of work protocols, thus it avoids some of the issues involved in such protocol such as massive energy waste and mining pooling and centralization.

Spacemesh software is designed to run on real people's home PCs and not on dedicated cloud servers or specialized non-commodity hardware. A consensus on a distributed canonical ledger is formed by a protocol running on a home PCs from around the globe and without a central server as long as there's a majority of honest people running the Spacemesh software on their PCs.

## What is the Spacemesh Testnet?
The Spacemesh Testnet is a beta public release of the Spacemesh p2p software platform. Anyone with a computer and Internet connection can join without any permission from anyone and participate in the Spacemesh p2p network.

The Testnet is designed to test the Spacemesh protocols and software prior to release of the Spacemesh Mainnet and the Spacemesh cryptocurrency. Note that the cryptocurrency enabled by the Testnet is monopoly money without any real world value. The Testnet is designed to run security and code audits of the Spacemesh software and protocols.

## Why should I join?
Joining the Testnet helps Spacemesh launch a high-quality Mainnet and the Spacemesh Coins cryptocurrency. It also helps you to prepare your for participation in the Spacemesh Mainnet once it launches and earn Spacemesh coins validation awards for your participation. Bottom line, if you care about Spacemesh and plan to participate in its Mainnet then you should join the Testnet.

## How can I join?
Just follow our interactive guide to join the Testnet. Let's [get started](guide/install.md)!
