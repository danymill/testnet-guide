# Spacemesh Dictionary

## Smesh coins (SMCH)
The native cryptocurrency maintained by the Spacemesh distributed ledger.
One Spacemesh Coin equals to 10^18 Spacemesh Cents.

## Smetoshi
The basic unit of accounting in the Spacemesh platform. Used mostly by developers in the platform's code and for transaction fees.

## Smidgen
1,000 Smidgens are 1 Smesh coin.

## Node (aka Smesher)
The Node is the software that maintains and updates the Spacemesh distributed computer and the Smesh coin distributed ledger and the Spacemesh computer storage. The Spacemesh platform is created by people just like you who run the full p2p node in the App on their desktop computers. Your Node participates in the Spacemesh Protocol and you earn mining awards for your participation. The Spacemesh full p2p node is responsible for the mining process. You run a full node by running the Spacemesh App on your computer or by building and running the go-spacemesh full node directly from source code if you are a developer.

## Wallet
The Wallet is a basic Spacemesh Coins wallet that is used to maintain coin accounts, execute transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts. The wallet is included in the Spacemesh App.

## Account
Think of this account as your crypto bank account. The Wallet is configured with one main account called `Main Account`. You use this account to hold Spacemesh Coins and to send and receive Spacemesh Coins. You can create additional accounts in the Spacemesh Wallet or in the CLI Wallet.

## Address
Each account is identified by one unique `public address`. An address is displayed in a short-form such as this: `0xebee....ee0443`. The full account address is a long number such as: `0xebee4e63a6b0f829f3ad06fb6c4aa80a6860774bc25e9c1b1b2c69b8b4ee0443`.

## App
The App integrates the Wallet, the Node and the block producing process into one package which we hope you are going to find delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts. The App is available for Windows 10, OS X and Linux. (TODO: add sys requirements page link)

## Free Disk Space Commitment
Explain here...

## Block Producing
Block producing is the process of submitting blocks with transactions to the Testnet network, and participating in the Spacemesh consensus protocol by your Node. Before you can produce any blocks, you need to allocate XXXX free storage on your computer hard-drive to Spacemesh. This allocation is a one-time process that you only need to do once. You can use the disk space you allocated to Spacemesh indefinitely.

You will be prompted to configure mining when you run the Spacemesh App for the first time on your computer. You can also setup mining when running a full p2p node in console mode.

## Coin Awards
Smesh coins awarded to people who run nodes which produce blocks on their computers. People who run Node have setup block producing and participate in the protocol by leaving their App running 24x7 are entitled to these awards.

## Layer Coin awards
A fixed award amount in Smesh coins set as the total award to be distributed between all block producers who have produced a valid block in a layer. This amount is a protocol constant.

## Coin Awards Account
Coin awards are always awarded to a specific wallet account which is associated with a Node by a Node owner. When you use the App, your Wallet's the main account is automatically used as your Coin Awards Account.

## Smesh Transaction
A transaction from one account (sender) to another account (recipient) in which a specific amount of Smesh coins is transferred from sender to recipient. Transactions are executed from the wallet.

## Smesh Transaction Fee
