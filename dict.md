# Spacemesh Dictionary

## Smesh coins (SMCH)
The native cryptocurrency maintained by the Spacemesh distributed ledger.
One Spacemesh Coin equals to 10^18 Spacemesh Cents.

## Smetoshi
The basic unit of accounting in the Spacemesh platform. Used mostly by developers in the platform's code and for transaction fees.

## Smidgen
1,000 Smidgens are 1 Smesh coin.

## Node (aka Smesher)
The Node is the software that maintains and updates the Spacemesh distributed computer and the Smesh coin distributed ledger and the Spacemesh computer storage. The Spacemesh platform is created by people just like you who run the full p2p node in the App on their desktop computers. Your Node participates in the Spacemesh Protocol and you earn mining awards for your participation. The Spacemesh full p2p node is responsible for the mining process. You run a full node by running the Spacemesh App on your computer or by building and running the go-spacemesh full node directly from source code if you are a developer.

## Wallet
The Wallet is a basic Spacemesh Coins wallet that is used to maintain coin accounts, execute transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts. The wallet is included in the Spacemesh App.

## Accounts
Think of this account as your crypto bank account. The Wallet is configured with one main account called `Main Account`. You use this account to hold Spacemesh Coins and to send and receive Spacemesh Coins. You can create additional accounts in the Spacemesh Wallet or in the CLI Wallet.

## Addresses
Each account is identified by one unique `public address`. An address is displayed in a short-form such as this: `0xebee....ee0443`. The full account address is a long number such as: `0xebee4e63a6b0f829f3ad06fb6c4aa80a6860774bc25e9c1b1b2c69b8b4ee0443`.

## Spacemesh App
The Spacemesh App integrates the Spacemesh Wallet, a full p2p node and mining into one package which we hope you are going to find delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts. It is available for Linux, OS X and Windows 10.

## Block Producing
Block producing is the process of submitting blocks with transactions to the Testnet network, and participating in the Spacemesh consensus protocol by your Node. Before you can produce any blocks, you need to allocate XXXX free storage on your computer hard-drive to Spacemesh. This allocation is a one-time process that you only need to do once. You can use the disk space you allocated to Spacemesh indefinitely.

You will be prompted to configure mining when you run the Spacemesh App for the first time on your computer. You can also setup mining when running a full p2p node in console mode.

## Coin Awards
Spacemesh Coins awarded to full p2p node operators. People who run the Spacemesh full p2p node have setup mining and participate in the protocol by leaving their App running 24x7 are entitled to Spacemesh Coin awards.

## Layer Coin awards
The fixed award amount in SMC. The amount is a protocol constant. It is distributed to all full nodes who have submitted blocks to a layer.

## Coin Awards Account
Coin awards are always awarded to one wallet account specified by the full p2p node owner. When you use the Spacemesh App, the main account in your wallet is automatically used as your coins award account.

## Smesh Transaction
A transaction from one account (sender) to another account (recipient) in which a specific amount of Smesh coins is transferred from sender to recipient. Transactions are executed from the wallet.

## Smesh Transaction Fee
