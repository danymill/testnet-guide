# Spacemesh Dictionary

## Spacemesh Coins (SMC / Shmekels)
The native cryptocurrency maintained by the Spacemesh distributed ledger.
One Spacemesh Coin equals to 10^18 Spacemesh Cents.

## Spacemesh Cents (Lerners)
The basic unit of accounting in the Spacemesh platform. Used mostly by developers in the platform's code and for transaction fees.

## Spacemesh Silver (SMS)
1,000 Spacemesh Silvers are 1 Spacemesh Coins.

## Spacemesh Full Node (Full Node)
The Spacemesh full node (aka full p2p node) is the software that maintains and updates the Spacemesh distributed computer and the Spacemesh Coin distributed ledger and the Spacemesh computer storage. The Spacemesh platform is created by people just like you who run the full p2p node in the App on their desktop computers. Your node participates in the Spacemesh Protocol and you earn mining awards for your participation. The Spacemesh full p2p node is responsible for the mining process. You run a full node by running the Spacemesh App on your computer or by building and running the go-spacemesh full node directly from source code if you are a developer.

## Wallet
The Wallet is a basic Spacemesh Coins wallet that is used to maintain coin accounts, execute transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts. The wallet is included in the Spacemesh App.

## Accounts
Think of this account as your crypto bank account. The Wallet is configured with one main account called `Main Account`. You use this account to hold Spacemesh Coins and to send and receive Spacemesh Coins. You can create additional accounts in the Spacemesh Wallet or in the CLI Wallet.

## Addresses
Each account is identified by one unique `public address`. An address is displayed in a short-form such as this: `0xebee....ee0443`. The full account address is a long number such as: `0xebee4e63a6b0f829f3ad06fb6c4aa80a6860774bc25e9c1b1b2c69b8b4ee0443`.

## Spacemesh App
The Spacemesh App integrates the Spacemesh Wallet, a full p2p node and mining into one package which we hope you are going to find delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts. It is available for Linux, OS X and Windows 10.

## Mining
Spacemesh Mining is the process of submitting blocks with transactions to the Testnet network, and participating in the Spacemesh consensus protocol. Mining is managed by your Spacemesh full p2p node. Before you can mine, you need to allocate XXXX free storage on your computer hard-drive to Spacemesh. This allocation is a one-time process that you only need to do once. You can use the disk space you allocated to Spacemesh indefinitely.

You will be prompted to start mining and to configure mining when you run the Spacemesh App for the first time on your computer. You can also setup mining when running a full p2p node in console mode.

## Coin Awards
Spacemesh Coins awarded to full p2p node operators. People who run the Spacemesh full p2p node have setup mining and participate in the protocol by leaving their App running 24x7 are entitled to Spacemesh Coin awards.

## Layer Coin awards
The fixed award amount in SMC. The amount is a protocol constant. It is distributed to all full nodes who have submitted blocks to a layer.

## Coin Awards Account
Coin awards are always awarded to one wallet account specified by the full p2p node owner. When you use the Spacemesh App, the main account in your wallet is automatically used as your coins award account.

## Spacemesh Coin Transaction
A transaction from one account (sender) to another account (recipient) in which a specific amount of Spacemesh Coins is transferred from sender to recipient. Transactions are executed from the wallet.

## CLI Wallet
A `CLI Wallet` is a basic wallet available for users who can't run the App on their computer. It can be built from source code and can be used together with a Spacemesh full p2p node running in as a console app to setup mining and to perform basic Spacemesh Coins transactions.

## Tap
The Spacemesh Tap is a Discord channel which allows people to request and receive Spacemesh Coins to their accounts. It is useful for testing Spacemesh Coins transactions.

## Wallet-only Mode
The App can run in a wallet-only mode. In this mode, you are not running a full p2p node but you can use the wallet features such as checking your balance, executing transactions and viewing transactions logs. In this mode, your App is connected to the Spacemesh network via an Internet gateway. Since you are not running a full node in this mode, you will not get any awards distributed by the protocol to full node operators.
