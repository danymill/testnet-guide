# Spacemesh Dictionary

## Smesh (SMH)
The name of the Spacemesh cryptocurrency for the Spacemesh Testnets. One Smesh equals to one trillion (10^12) Smidge. The App enables you to send and receive Smesh.

## Smidge
The basic unit of accounting in the Spacemesh ledger and platform. Transaction fees on Smesh transactions are displayed in Smidge units in the App. One trillion (10^12) Smidge equals to one Smesh.

## Smesher
Smesher is the software package that maintains and updates the Spacemesh decentralized ledger according to the Spacemesh protocol. Smeshers form a p2p network by communicating with each other over the Internet.

The Spacemesh decentralized ledger is created and secured by people just like you who run a Smesher in the Spacemesh App on their desktop computers.


Your Smesher is responsible for submitting blocks with Smesh transactions to the network according to the Spacemesh protocol. We call this Smeshing. You earn smeshing rewards for smeshing.

The Spacemesh App for your desktop computer includes a Smesher and manages it for you. Future releases of the Testnet will support building and running a Smesher directly from source code.

## Wallet
A basic wallet used to work with Smesh accounts, execute Smesh transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts designated to one of your account. The wallet is bundled in the Spacemesh App.

## Account
Your Smesh crypto bank account. By default, your Wallet is configured with one main account called `Main Account`. You use this account to hold Smesh and to send and receive Smesh. You can also add additional accounts to your Wallet.

## Address
Each account is identified by one unique `public address`. An address is displayed in a short-form such as this: `0xebee....ee0443`. The full account address is a long number such as: `0xebee4e63a6b0f829f3ad06fb6c4aa80a6860774bc25e9c1b1b2c69b8b4ee0443`. You can freely share your account's address with anyone.

## App
The App integrates the Wallet, the Smesher and into one package which we hope you are going to find delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts. The App is available for Windows 10, OS X and Linux. (TODO: add sys requirements page link)

## Free Disk Space Commitment
Explain here...

## Smeshing
Smeshing is the process of submitting blocks with transactions to the Testnet network according to the Spacemesh protocol. Before you can smesh blocks, you need to commit XXXX free storage on your computer hard drive to Spacemesh. This commitment is a one-time process that you only need to do once. You can use the disk space you committed to Spacemesh indefinitely.

You will be prompted to set up smeshing when you run the App for the first time on your desktop computer.

## Smeshing Rewards
Smesh are rewarded to people who run Smeshers on their computes and submit blocks with transactions to the network according to the Spacemesh protocol. To earn smeshing rewards, you need to commit free space on your computer to Spacemesh and leave the app running 24/7 so it will smesh for you when the protocol determines you are entitled to do so. The protocol determines when Smeshers are supposed to smesh blocks on an on going basis.

## Smeshing Rewards Account
Smeshing rewards are always given to a specific wallet account. For this release of the Spacemesh App, this account is automatically set by the App for you when you set up smeshing on your first app session. When you run the App for the first time and set up smeshing, the app uses your wallet's main account as the rewards account.

## Smesh Transactions
A Smesh transaction is a transaction from one account (sender) to another account (recipient) in which a specific amount of Smesh is transferred from sender to recipient. Transactions are executed from the wallet.
