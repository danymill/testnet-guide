# Checking Status

When the initial setup is done you should see this screen:

![](../images/setup2.png)

You view your full node status in this screen.

Click on the wallet command at the left side of the screen, to access your Wallet screen, view your current coin balance and default address and to perform coin transactions.

?> You may now close the App by clicking on the close button. Your full node will keep running the background.

Just open the App again to access your wallet, view your full node status, to send Spacemesh Coins to anyone or to receive Spacemesh Coins from anyone.

## OS Configuration
!> Use your Operating System settings to disable your OS from shutting down or from entering hibernation mode after and idle time period to make sure your Spacemesh Full Node keeps running 24x7.

## That's all folks!
You did it - you are now up and running a Spacemesh full node, and you will start receiving coin awards for contributing to the Spacemesh platform.

?> Remember to leave your computer open 24x7 to fully participate in the Spacemesh platform and to win coin awards for your contribution.
