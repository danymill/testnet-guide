# Checking Node Status

Open the App if it is not already open and click on the `NODE` tab on the top-left of the main window.

You should now see the Node status screen:

This screen is where you will track your Node operation, and view your total block producing coin awards.

You can also pause (or un-pause) your Node by clicking on the `PAUSE NODE` button.


Click the close button in the App main Window.

You will be prompted to quit the app or to switch it to run in the background. Choose `Keep running in background` so that your node will keep running and produce blocks.

### Awards Expectancy
If you have committed storage and leave your app running 24x7 and your network is [properly configured](../netconfig.md) then you should expect your first block producing award in about 49 hours.

?> Remember to leave your computer running 24/7 to fully participate in the Spacemesh platform and win coin awards for your contribution.

## Well Done!

You did it - you are now up and running a Node, and you will start receiving coin awards for producing blocks to the Spacemesh platform.
