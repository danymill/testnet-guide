# Setting up a Full Node

The Spacemesh App now prompts you to setup a full  node on your computer.

?> A `Spacemesh full node` is the software you run on your computer to join the Spacemesh global computer. This Spacemesh global computer is created from many p2p full nodes operated by people like you running on personal computers from all over the world. The nodes communicate with each other over the Internet to secure and maintain the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency and the Spacemesh computer state.

Click the orange `Setup` button and follow the on-screen instructions...

?> You can use the wallet features of the Spacemesh App without running a `Spacemesh Full Node` by clicking on `Maybe Later` when prompted to setup a node in the App. This is useful if you are running a full node on another computer and just want to view your coin balance or transact with Spacemesh Coins.

## Storage Setup
Spacemesh is using a novel consensus protocol which instead of constantly solving computational puzzles with your CPU, is using a one-time setup phase that utilizes free space on your hard drive.

The storage you commit defines your identity on the Spacemesh computer and determines your awards eligibility.

The more storage you commit, the more frequent your Spacemesh coin award frequency will be.

Follow the on-screen setup instructions to specify how much hard-drive free space you'd like to commit to your Spacemesh identity.

!> The free space you commit to your full node is not used store any useful data files. The free space you allocate is filled with cryptographic data by the setup process that is only used to establish your node identity and your awards eligibility according the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

Click 'Start Setup' to start the storage setup process. You should now see the setup progress screen...

This may take a while depending on your system, but you should be able to use your computer as you normally do.

!> Do not shut down your computer while the setup is in progress.

You will get notified in this screen when the setup is complete and when you have been awarded Spacemesh coin for your participation in the platform.

?> You may minimize the App and access it again later or even close it and open it later. The full node runs in the background even when the App is minimized or closed.
