# Full Node Setup

The Spacemesh App now prompts you to setup a full  node.

?> A `Spacemesh full node` is the software you run on your computer to join the Spacemesh global computer. This Spacemesh global computer is created from many p2p full nodes operated by people like you running on personal computers from all over the world. The nodes communicate with each other over the Internet to secure and maintain the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency and the Spacemesh computer state.

Click on `Setup` and follow the on-screen instructions...

?> You can use the wallet features of the Spacemesh App without running a `Spacemesh Full Node` by clicking on `Maybe Later` when prompted to setup a node in the App. This is useful if you are running a full node on another computer and just want to view your coin balance or transact with Spacemesh Coins.

## Storage Setup
Spacemesh is using a novel consensus protocol which instead of constantly solving computational puzzles with your CPU, is using a one-time setup phase that utilizes free space on your hard drive. The storage you commit defined your identity on the Spacemesh computer and determines your awards eligibility.

The more storage you commit, the more frequent your Spacemesh coin award frequency will be.

Follow the on-screen setup instructions to specify how much free space from your hard drive you'd like to commit to your Spacemesh identity.

!> The storage you commit to Spacemesh is not used by the platform to store any useful data. It is filled with cryptographic data that is only used to establish your node identity and is used in the Spacemesh consensus protocol.

Click 'Next' to start the storage setup process. This may take a while but you should be able to use your computer as you normally do.

!> Do not shut down your computer while the setup is in progress.

You can minimize the App now and access it again later. You will get notified on this screen when the setup is complete and you have been awarded Spacemesh coin for your participation in the platform.
