# Installing and Running the Spacemesh App

To join the Testnet you need to run the Spacemesh App on your desktop computer.

## About The Spacemesh App
The Spacemesh App includes the `Spacemesh Miner`, the `Spacemesh full p2p node`, and a basic `Spacemesh Coins wallet`.

The `Spacemesh Miner` is responsible for allocating storage on your computer hard-drive for the security of the Spacemesh network. Mining in Spacemesh is a one-time process that you only need to run once.

The `Spacemesh full p2p node` is the software that maintains and updates the Spacemesh distributed computer and the Spacemesh Coin distributed ledger. The Spacemesh platform is created by people like you running full p2p nodes on their desktop computers. Your node participates in the Spacemesh Protocol and you earn mining awards for your participation.

The `Spacemesh Coins Wallet` is a basic wallet that you use to maintain coin accounts, execute transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts.

The App integrates all of these features into one package which we hope you are going to find delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts.

You do NOT need to run any additional software to join the Testnet besides running the App on your computer.

You install the App to setup mining, run the full p2p node, and you use the wallet to setup an award account for your full node and to perform basic Spacemesh Coin transactions.

Follow the instructions on this page to download, install and run the Spacemesh App.
