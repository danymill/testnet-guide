2. Paste the Smesh recipient public account address that he or she shared with you into the `Send to` field.

3. Enter the Smesh (SMH) amount you would like to send to the recipient in the `Amount to send` field.

> The amount must be less than your account's Smesh balance, as you cannot spend Smesh that you do not have.
