# Using the CLI Wallet

The CLI Wallet is designed to use together with a locally running p2p full node. You need to use it only you are not using the Spacemesh App on your computer as the App already includes a Wallet.

On Linux platforms that do not support Electron App, using the CLI wallet together with a console full p2p node is your only option.

TODO: add instructions here on how to use the CLI wallet with a locally running full p2p node..
