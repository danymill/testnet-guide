The Spacemesh App now prompts you to setup a full node.

A full node is...


Click on 'Setup' and follow the on-screen instructions.

> You can use the wallet features of the App without running a full Spacemesh node by clicking on 'Later' when prompted to setup a node in the App.
This is useful if you are running a full node on another computer and wishes to view your balance or transact with Spacemesh Coins using the wallet on another computer.

TODO: this is the main help page for assisting users in setting up a full node - POST commitment, coinbase awards account, etc...

Explain POST size increase, etc...

Follow the setup progress and look for coin awards notifications in this screen.
