### About Accounts and Addresses
By default, your Spacemesh Wallet has one main account. That account has one public address you can share with anyone in order to receive Smesh.

1. Click on the `REQUEST <-` button on your wallet screen:

3. Send the copied address to a friend to request that they send you SMH. You can paste the address directly into an app such as Whatsapp, Signal, or Telegram.

4. Ask that person to [send SMH](send_coin.md) to this address using his or her Spacemesh wallet.

> Once Smesh are sent to you, you should see the transaction in the `Transactions` section of your wallet screen, and your account Smesh balance should be updated to include the received SMH.
