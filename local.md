# Spacemesh Local Testnet (Localnet)

Follow this guide to build from source and run a local Spacemesh Testent (localent) with 6 full nodes and the POET support service on your computer using docker. This is a great way to get a feel for the protocol and the platform and to start hacking on Spacemesh.

?> This guide is for developers who are comfortable with the command line, Docker and dev tool chains.

## Prerequisites and Running
ðŸ‘‰ `OS X` or a `Linux` system. Windows support is not fully tested yet.
ðŸ‘‰ Follow the instructions in the local testnet repo [readme file](https://github.com/spacemeshos/local-testnet) to install the prerequisites and to build and run the testnet.

If all works as expected, you should have a terminal window showing output similar to this:

`TODO: add screen shot of testnet here`

## Working with the testnet
